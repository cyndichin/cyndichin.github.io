Welcome! I'm Cyndi.

Currently, I am an iOS Engineer at CNBC with a business and cybersecurity background. Additionally, I am also a part-time student enrolled in the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech. 

I am interested in the intersection of education and technology and hope to work on projects to empower others to learn and grow. 

I spend my free time snowboarding, playing board games and reading articles about tech, productivity, health and finances. Overall, I am passionate about learning and I am currently exploring the path of becoming a more experienced iOS Developer.
