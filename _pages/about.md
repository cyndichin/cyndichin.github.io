Welcome! I'm Cyndi.

I am an iOS Software Engineer at CNBC with a background in business and cybersecurity. Additionally, I am enrolled in the OMSCS program at Georgia Tech as a part-time student. 

I am interested in the intersection of education and technology and hope to work on projects to empower others to learn and grow. 

During my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, exercising, playing board games, reading self-help books, and raving about boba + sushi.

Overall, I am passionate about lifelong learning and I am currently exploring the path of becoming a more experienced mobile Developer.
