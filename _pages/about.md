Welcome! I'm Cyndi.

I am an iOS Software Engineer at Mozilla. My career took many different turns before finding my passion in creating mobile apps. Previously, I worked in the business (accounting, finance) and cybersecurity industry.

I am interested in the intersection of education and technology and hope to work on projects to empower others to learn and grow. 

During my free time, I enjoy snowboarding, exercising, playing board games, reading self-help books, and raving about boba + sushi.

Overall, I am passionate about lifelong learning and I am constantly improving to become a senior mobile developer.
