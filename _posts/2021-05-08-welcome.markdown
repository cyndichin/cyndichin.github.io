Hello! Welcome to my personal website, where I will discuss a bit about myself, display some projects I worked on and host my blog posts. Currently, this website is under construction until I put all the pieces together. I am using Github Pages, Jekyll and a Jekyll theme to develop this site.

# The Beginning

I thought of starting a blog many many times -- to serve as a self-reflection, to help others learn from my lessons learned, and to conquer my fears.

Recently, I've read Ali Abdaal's post on "Getting over the fear of personal blogging" and it really resonated with me. All the concerns he has were similar to mine as I always was afraid of putting out a blog for everyone to see. I didn't think I was good enough to write about anything and felt that I needed to wait until I became an expert in the field. 

However, I picked up reading 'Show your Work' by Austin Kleon and it truly influenced me to restructure the way I think and to start this blog for self-reflection and hopefully for others to take something away.

Today is a beginning of a new era where I document my journey.
