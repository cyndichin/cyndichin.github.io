# The Beginning

I thought of starting a blog many many times -- to serve as a self-reflection, to help others learn from my lessons learned, and to conquer my fears.

Recently, I've read Ali Abdaal's post on "Getting over the fear of personal blogging" and it really resonated with me. All the concerns he has were similar to mine as I always was afraid of putting out a blog for everyone to see. I didn't think I was good enough to write about anything and felt that I needed to wait until I became an expert in the field. 

However, I picked up reading 'Show your Work' by Austin Kleon and it truly influenced me to restructure the way I think and to start this blog for self-reflection and hopefully for others to take something away. With all the fears and doubts that I have when it comes to putting myself out there, I hope that this will help others find their own path and encourage them to pursue their dreams.

Today is a beginning of a new era where I document my journey.
